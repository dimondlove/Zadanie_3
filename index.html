	<h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>

	<h3>Linear Equations</h3>

	<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
	<p class="formula">ax + b = 0</p>
	<p>where <span class="highlighting">a</span> and <span class="highlighting">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="highlighting">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="highlighting">x</span> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="highlighting">x</span> there.</p>

	<h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>

	<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
	<p class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
	<p>where <span class="highlighting">a</span>, <span class="highlighting">b</span>, <span class="highlighting">c</span> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="highlighting">a</span> can't be 0.</p>

	<h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
	<p><span class="highlighting">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="highlighting">r</span>) squared:</p>
	<p class="formula">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="highlighting">D</span>):</p>
	<p class="formula">A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="highlighting">C</span>):</p>
	<p class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</p>

	<h3>Intersection</h3>

	<p>The intersection of two sets <span class="highlighting">A</span> and <span class="highlighting">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
	<p class="formula"> A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</p>
	<p>That is, <span class="highlighting">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="highlighting">x</span> is both an element of <span class="highlighting">A</span> and an element of <span class="highlighting">B</span>.</p>
